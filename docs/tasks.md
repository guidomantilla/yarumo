# Yarumo Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Yarumo project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Documentation Improvements

- [ ] 1. Enhance README.md with comprehensive project description, features, installation instructions, and usage examples
- [ ] 2. Add godoc comments to all exported functions, types, and packages
- [ ] 3. Create architecture diagrams explaining the relationships between packages
- [ ] 4. Document the rules engine DSL syntax and provide examples
- [ ] 5. Add examples for common use cases of each package

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] 6. Add unit tests for all packages, aiming for at least 80% code coverage
- [ ] 7. Implement integration tests for the rules engine
- [ ] 8. Add benchmarks for performance-critical components
- [ ] 9. Standardize error handling across all packages
- [ ] 10. Add context support consistently across all functions
- [ ] 11. Improve error messages to be more descriptive and actionable
- [ ] 12. Add validation for all function parameters

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] 13. Refactor the singleton pattern in boot/context.go to avoid potential race conditions
- [ ] 14. Implement a more flexible plugin system for extending the rules engine
- [ ] 15. Separate the rules DSL parser into its own package
- [ ] 16. Create interfaces for all major components to improve testability
- [ ] 17. Reduce coupling between packages by defining clear boundaries
- [ ] 18. Implement a more robust dependency injection system

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] 19. Add support for rule prioritization and conflict resolution
- [ ] 20. Implement rule caching for improved performance
- [ ] 21. Add support for rule versioning and migration
- [ ] 22. Implement a rule visualization tool
- [ ] 23. Add support for loading rules from external sources (files, databases)
- [ ] 24. Implement a rule validation system to detect contradictions
- [ ] 25. Add support for rule templates and inheritance

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] 26. Optimize the rule parser for large rule sets
- [ ] 27. Implement parallel rule evaluation for independent rules
- [ ] 28. Add memory pooling for frequently created objects
- [ ] 29. Optimize string operations in the parser
- [ ] 30. Implement lazy loading of components in the boot package

## Security Improvements

- [ ] 31. Conduct a security audit of cryptographic functions
- [ ] 32. Ensure all cryptographic operations use secure defaults
- [ ] 33. Implement rate limiting for rule evaluation to prevent DoS attacks
- [ ] 34. Add input sanitization for rule parsing
- [ ] 35. Ensure secure handling of sensitive data in logs

## Build and CI/CD Improvements

- [ ] 37. Implement automated code quality checks (golangci-lint)
- [ ] 38. Add automated security scanning
- [ ] 39. Implement semantic versioning and release automation
- [ ] 40. Create Docker containers for easy deployment

## Maintenance Tasks
